# Options Pricing FFT
Options Pricing using a Fast Fourier Transform

This project will include a research into applying the Fast Fourier Tranform to obtain the price of a given option. Motivation for this includes the efficiency of the FFT that I have discovered in previous projects as well as expanding my knowledge on Options Pricing.
